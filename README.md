# 🍔 Food Delivery App — Low-Fidelity Wireframe #
📱 Project Overview 

This project is part of my internship task to design a low-fidelity wireframe for a Food Delivery App. It outlines the core user flow — from browsing restaurants to order confirmation — focusing on layout, structure, and usability.

💡 Learning Outcome

Through this task, I learned to plan app structure, ensure logical navigation, and communicate ideas through low-fidelity wireframes — a key step before high-fidelity UI design.
